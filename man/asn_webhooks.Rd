\description{
Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in addition
 to the ability to fetch those changes directly as
 [Events](/developers/api-reference/events) - in fact, Webhooks are just a way
 to receive Events via HTTP POST at the time they occur instead of polling for
 them. For services accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient,
 and if events are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.
 
 In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer to
 the [Events documentation](/developers/api-reference/events) for more
 information on what data these events contain.
 
 **NOTE:** While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target, the
 Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual resource
 they are referencing. So while a normal event you receive via GET /events
 would look like this:
 
     {\
       "resource": {\
         "id": 1337,\
         "name": "My Task"\
       },\
       "parent": null,\
       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
       "user": {\
         "id": 1123,\
         "name": "Tom Bizarro"\
       },\
       "action": "changed",\
       "type": "task"\
     }
 
 In a Webhook payload you would instead receive this:
 
     {\
       "resource": 1337,\
       "parent": null,\
       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
       "user": 1123,\
       "action": "changed",\
       "type": "task"\
     }
 
 Webhooks themselves contain only the information necessary to deliver the
 events to the desired target as they are generated.
