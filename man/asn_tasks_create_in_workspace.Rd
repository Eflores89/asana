\title{Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint
with a data block containing the fields you'd like to set on the task.
Any unspecified fields will take on default values.}
\usage{
asn_tasks_create_in_workspace(workspace, ..., options = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{workspace}{{Id} The workspace to create a task in.#'}

\item{...}{{Object} Data for the request}
}
\description{
Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
explicitly if you specify a `project` or a `parent` task instead.
}
