asana
=====

An R package for accessing the Asana API.

Installation
------------

One day, you will be able to install the released version of `asana` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("asana")
```

For now, install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("datacamp/asana")
```

Get an API token from Asana and make sure to set it in your `.Renviron` file. You can run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to automatically pull up your `.Renviron` file in RStudio for editing.

```
ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxx
```
